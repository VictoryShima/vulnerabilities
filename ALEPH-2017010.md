The Nexus 9 device contains a SoC manufactured by Cywee which implements a “Sensor Hub”. The SoC is an `STM32F401B/C` ARM Cortext-M4 MCU, managed by a driver available under [drivers/i2c/chips/CwMcuSensor.c](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/tegra/+/android-7.1.1_r0.53/drivers/i2c/chips/CwMcuSensor.c). The platform communicates with SensorHub via I$$^2$$C bus #0 and via 4 GPIO ports. See the [device tree](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/tegra/+/android-7.1.1_r0.53/arch/arm64/boot/dts/tegra132-flounder-xdxepvt.dts).

The MCU has two modes:
1. *Application mode.* This is the normal firmware operation, where the MCU provides the sensors' data via I$$^2$$C (slave address 0x72). 
2. [*Bootloader mode*](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/b9/9b/16/3a/12/1e/40/0c/CD00167594.pdf/files/CD00167594.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00167594.pdf). This mode allows for firmware management via various interfaces, including I$$^2$$C (slave address 0x39). The MCU switches to the bootloader mode when the [bootloader activation Pattern 1](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/4c/68/fe/72/a8/cd/47/83/DM00072315.pdf/files/DM00072315.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00072315.pdf) is detected. 

Upon the platform boot, the CwMcuSensor driver queries the firmware's version (I$$^2$$C register 0x10). If it does not match the one found in the vendor's partition (/vendor/firmware/sensor_hub.img), it switches to the bootloader mode, and upgrades the firmware (again, [via I$$^2$$C](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/35/7d/5b/bf/67/75/41/d6/CD00251611.pdf/files/CD00251611.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00251611.pdf)). Please note that the firmware is not signed. 

By issuing a proprietary fastboot oem command `sensorhubflash`, a physical attacker / malicious charger / malicious headphones (via the UART interface, exposed by the headphones jack -- see our [blog post](https://alephsecurity.com/2017/03/08/nexus9-fiq-debugger/)) can downgrade the SensorHub firmware to an old version, saved under the `SER` partition (`/dev/block/mmcblk0p19`). This version may contain vulnerabilities which may allow the attacker to compromise the MCU. 

One may claim that it is not an issue because the platform would immediately upgrade the firmware upon boot (since its version is different from the one found in the vendor image), however, in Nexus 9, the I$$^2$$C buses could be accessed via the fastboot interface, by using the `fastboot oem {i2cr, i2cw, i2crNoAddr, i2cwNoAddr, i2cdetect}` commands. (I$$^2$$C could also be accessed via UART, in the HBOOT mode.) Thus, the attacker could interact with the old firmware BEFORE it was replaced by the platform using I$$^2$$C, and thus potentially exploit a security vulnerability which would allow him to return a bogus version identifier, bypassing the platform's check. Please note that the SoC's I$$^{2}$$C code runs in privileged mode.

The next figure depicts the attack. The device is already in the fastboot mode. We first queried the current firmware version ID, by reading I$$^2$$C register `0x10`. This ID corresponds to *"Firmware Architecture version 1, Sense version 0, Cywee lib version 16, Water number 40, Active Engine 2, Project Mapping 1"*. We then downgraded to the old firmware, and re-queried the firmware ID. As we can see, the old firmware is up and running, and returns a version ID which corresponds to *"Firmware Architecture version 1, Sense version 0, Cywee lib version 10, Water number 19, Active Engine 1, Project Mapping 1"*, much older!.

## PoC & Further Research ##

In addition to fetching the old firmware image from the flash (`SER` partition), for the sake of curiousity we also successfully obtained it from the SoC itself:
1. We downgraded the SoC firmware by exploiting the vulnerability.
2. We modified the `CwMcuSensor` driver (PoC can be found [here](https://github.com/alephsecurity/PoCs/tree/master/CVE-2017-0582)). We disabled the firmware version check, and added a `sysfs` interface which allowed us to reboot the MCU into its bootloader mode and issue the bootloader `READMEMORY` [command](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/35/7d/5b/bf/67/75/41/d6/CD00251611.pdf/files/CD00251611.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00251611.pdf). 
3. We fetched the firmware from address `0x08000000`

One can now take the old firmware and search for vulnerabilities.

## Patch ##
Google patched the vulnerability on build `N4F27B` / bootloader `3.50.0.0143` by removing the `sesonsrhubflash` bootloader command:
```terminal
...
$ fastboot oem sensorhubflash
(bootloader) [ERR] Command error !!!
OKAY [  0.013s]
finished. total time: 0.015s
```
In addition, access to the I$$^2$$C buses has also been removed from the bootloader -- the I$$^2$$C related bootloader commands are no longer available:
```terminal
$ fastboot oem i2cr 1 0xb8 6 1
...
(bootloader) [ERR] Command error !!!
OKAY [  0.011s]

finished. total time: 0.012s
```

Please note that although Google published the advisory on the April Security Bulletin, the patch has been included only since the April 5 2017 Security Patch Level, where the April Nexus 9 image (`N4F26X`) has the April 1 2017 Security  Patch Level, hence it does not contain the patched bootloader.
