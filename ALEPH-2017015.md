The vulnerable code can be found in  `IOFireWireAVC-424/IOFireWireAVC/IOFireWireAVCUserClient.cpp`:
```c
[...]
case kIOFWAVCUserClientCreateAsyncAVCCommand:
	result = CreateAVCAsyncCommand((UInt8*)arguments->structureInput, 
              (UInt8*)arguments->structureOutput, 
			  arguments->structureInputSize, 
			  (UInt32*)&arguments->structureOutputSize);
	break; 
[...]
```
`structureInputSize` is a value that is controlled by the user passing the arguments from userspace, and it is used to determine a command length. However, the called function `CreateAVCAsyncCommand` fails to properly validate the length.

```c
IOReturn IOFireWireAVCUserClient::CreateAVCAsyncCommand(UInt8 * cmd, UInt8 *   asyncAVCCommandHandle, UInt32 len, UInt32 *refSize)
{
	IOReturn res = kIOReturnNoMemory;
	UInt32 *pReturnedCommandHandle = (UInt32*) asyncAVCCommandHandle;
	UInt32 cmdLen = len - sizeof(mach_vm_address_t);                             // decrease len by 8
	mach_vm_address_t *ppSharedBufAddress = (mach_vm_address_t*) &cmd[cmdLen];   // (a) 			
[...]		
	// Create the memory descriptor for the user/kernel shared response buffer
	pUCAsyncCommand->fMem = IOMemoryDescriptor::withAddressRange( *ppSharedBufAddress, 1024, kIODirectionInOut, fTask ) ;  // (b)
[...]
}
```
The function will create a user/kernel shared buffer (b), with an address pointer controlled by an attacker (a). This can lead to a variety of potentially dangerous situations such as a memory read and write.
