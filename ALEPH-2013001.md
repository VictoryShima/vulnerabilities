An off-path attacker can influence the SRTT algorithm implemented by BIND, in order to derandomize the NS selection, i.e. the attacker can easily and deterministically control the queried name server chosen by BIND’s resolver. The attack reduces
the time and effort required to successfully poison BIND’s cache.
