The random Profile Directory Name is written to the Android System Log (logcat) in various locations.
For instance, upon Firefox launch, the following data is written:
```terminal
D/GeckoProfile( 4766): Found profile dir: /data/data/.../files/mozilla/24pd90uh.default
```
In Android 4.0 and below, the Android log can easily be read by all applications including malicious ones
by acquiring the READ_LOGS permission.
