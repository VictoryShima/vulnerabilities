Due to lenient SELinux and DAC policy, vulnerable Synaptics DSX (touchscreen
driver) sysfs file entires are exposed to an attacker that executes code within
the mediaserver context on Android M 6.0.1 and system_server, bluetooth, nfc
contexts on Android N 7.0 (or any other SELinux domain that has target type
sysfs with the open and write permissions on file class).

The vulnerability has been found in the synaptics_dsx_fw_update.c.

On module initialization, a fixed-size heap buffer is created:
```c
static int synaptics_rmi4_fwu_init(struct synaptics_rmi4_data *rmi4_data)
{
    [...]
    fwu->image_name = kzalloc(MAX_IMAGE_NAME_LEN, GFP_KERNEL);
    if (!fwu->image_name) {
        dev_err(rmi4_data->pdev->dev.parent,
               "%s: Failed to alloc mem for image name\n",
             __func__);
        retval = -ENOMEM;
        goto exit_free_fwu;
    }
    [...]
}
```
Where MAX_IMAGE_NAME_LEN equals 256. The imagename sysfs device attribute is defined:
```c
static struct device_attribute attrs[] = {
    [...]
    __ATTR(imagename, S_IWUGO,
           synaptics_rmi4_show_error,
           fwu_sysfs_image_name_store),
    [...]
};
```
On a write() syscall, fwu_sysfs_image_name_store(), allows an attacker to overrun the previously
allocated heap buffer from userspace.
```c
static ssize_t fwu_sysfs_image_name_store(struct device *dev,
struct device_attribute *attr, const char *buf, size_t count)
{
    memcpy(fwu->image_name, buf, count);
    return count;
}
```
