OpenSSLX509Certificate is a Serializable class. It contains a 'finalize' method that later calls a native function with an attacker-controllabe pointer, eventually allowing for code execution by malicious apps.
Since this class is part of the Android framework, this vulnerability allows for code execution in services with high privileges, such as system_server.
