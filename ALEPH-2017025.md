title: 'Motorola Bootloader Old UTAGs may lead to Kernel Command-line Injection'

---
The fix for @CVE-2016-10277 (aka [initroot](https://github.com/alephsecurity/research/tree/master/initroot)) was to sanitize UTAGs (filtering ' ' and '=' for example), such that the adversary cannot inject arbitrary parameters into the kernel command line. 

The problem, however, is that the UTAGs, in the vulnerable versions of Android, are sanitized at the time of their modification -- when the user issues the `fastboot config` command, and not when they are actually inserted into the command line. 
Therefore, had the attack occurred before the bootloader was updated, the offending payload would remain intact:

```
