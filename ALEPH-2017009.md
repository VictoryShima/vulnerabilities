The Nexus 9 device contains a sensor SoC manufactured by Cypress. The sensor is managed by a driver available under [drivers/input/touchscreen/cy8c_sar.c](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/tegra/+/android-7.1.1_r0.53/drivers/input/touchscreen/cy8c_sar.c). The driver uses the sensor's data in order to regulate the radiation level emitted by the device.

The sensor communicates with the application processor via I$$^2$$C bus #1, which also provides a firmware update interface. During the platform boot, the driver samples the SoC's firmware's version via chip address `0x5{c,d}`, register `0x6`. If it is different than the one availble under `/vendor/firmware/sar{0,1}.img`, it initiates with a firmware flashing process (via I$$^2$$C chip address `0x6{0,1}`). It seems though that the firmware is not signed by Cypress, thus anyone having access to the I$$^2$$C bus, can reflash the firmware of the SoC. 

On Nexus 9 before build `N4F27B`, the I$$^2$$C bus could be accessed in four ways:

1. Directly by the kernel.
2. Via the `/dev/i2c-N` character devices. However, as per the SElinux policy in Nexus 9, these devices have the `i2c_device` context which can only be accessed when one is under the `su` domain -- only available on `eng`/`userdebug` builds, i.e. **not on production**.
3. Via the USB fastboot interface, accessible  by the `fastboot oem {i2cr, i2cw, i2crNoAddr, i2cwNoAddr}` commands:
```terminal
$ fastboot oem i2cr 1 0xb8 6 1
...
(bootloader) ret:0
(bootloader) > [1] = 1f 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
OKAY [  0.012s]
finished. total time: 0.013s
```
4. Via the `HBOOT` interface, available by UART (exposed by the headphones jack). The I$$^2$$C buses could be accessed by the `i2cr`, `i2cw`, `i2crNoAddr`, `i2cwNoAddr` commands:

```terminal
hboot> i2cr 1 0xb8 6 1
ret:0
     > [1] = 1f 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     
hboot>
```

Vectors 3 & 4 are especially significant because theoretically they can be used by either a physical attacker (rebooting the device into `fastboot`) or by **malicious chargers / headphones**. For example, a malicious charger connected to an ADB-enabled device may reboot the device into fastboot if the user authorizes the charger. As for headphones, on builds before `N4F26T` they could reboot the device into `HBOOT` by issuing `reboot oem-42` on the `FIQ` debugger prompt. See [our blog post](https://alephsecurity.com/2017/03/08/nexus9-fiq-debugger/) for more details.

## Proof-of-Concept ##
To demonstrate the SoC can be attacked via I$$^2$$C, we modified its firmware image. Then we managed to flash the modified image via the I$$^2$$C bus via the second vector using `i2ctools` (i.e. the test device ran our own AOSP-compiled, non-production build). The first firmware image we flashed, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/alephsecurity/PoCs/tree/master/CVE-2017-0563) increases the version to `0x3f`:
```terminal
flounder:/ # /data/local/tmp/i2cget -f -y 1 0x5c 0x6
/data/local/tmp/i2cget -f -y 1 0x5c 0x6
0x3f
flounder:/ #
```
The second broke the operation of the chip â€“ from that point forward, we could not reflash the chip since it stopped responding va I$$^2$$C:
```terminal
[   21.431832] CYPRESS_SAR: probe of 1-005d failed with error -1
[   61.118692] [SAR] active=80 
```
As for the 3rd and 4th vectors, HBOOT limits the number of command arguments to 16 which creates a technical difficulty controlling the last bytes of each firmware image line (which also contains the checksum) during the flashing process, however further research may show it can be bypassed as well.

## Patch ##
Google has patched the vulnerability on build `N4F27B` / bootloader `3.50.0.0143` by restricting access to the I$$^2$$C buses -- removing vectors 3 and 4. The I$$^2$$C related bootloader commands are no longer available:

```terminal
$ fastboot oem i2cr 1 0xb8 6 1
...
(bootloader) [ERR] Command error !!!
OKAY [  0.011s]

finished. total time: 0.012s
```

Please note that although Google published the advisory on the April Security Bulletin, the patch has been included only since the April 5 2017 Security Patch Level, where the April Nexus 9 image (`N4F26X`) has the April 1 2017 Security  Patch Level, hence it does not contain the patched bootloader.
