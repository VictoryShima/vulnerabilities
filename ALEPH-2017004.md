When a charger is connected to a powered off OnePlus 3/3T device, the platform starts `adbd` with [ADB authorization](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/adb/protocol.txt) disabled. Therefore, a malicious charger or a physical attacker can open up, without authorization, an ADB session with the device, in order to further exploit other vulnerabilities and/or exfiltrate information from the device. For example, the malicious charger can reboot the device into the bootloader mode (`fastboot`) in order to exploit `fastboot` related vulnerabilities, as detailed in the [blog post](/2017/03/26/oneplus3t-adb-charger/).

The following video presents how a 'charger' can exploit @CVE-2017-5622 & @CVE-2017-5626 for gaining a **root shell, putting SELinux in `permissive` mode, and even executing kernel code**:

The following video shows how a 'charger' exploits @CVE-2017-5622, @CVE-2017-5624 & @CVE-2017-5626 for replacing the `system` partition in order to **install a privileged app**. Please note that once the replacement is complete, the victim has no indication that the device has been tampered with:
