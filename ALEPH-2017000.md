---
Nexus 9 allows unauthorized access to the FIQ debugger via its headphones jack. This allows for sensitive information theft, via malicious headphones, out of any process. Moreover it allows the adversary to reboot the device into HBOOT, which may aid in further exploitation such as accessing internal SoCs via I$$2$$C. In addition, the attacker can conduct a Factory Reset.
