title: OnePlus 3/3T OxygenOS 4F500301 Bootloader Locking Bypass
product:
    - OnePlus 3T
    - OnePlus 3
vulnerable: 
    - OxygenOS prior to 4.0.2
      
severity: critical

OxygenOS before version 4.0.2 has two hidden fastboot `oem` commands: `fastboot oem 4F500301/2`
which allow the attacker to effectively lock/unlock the bootloader, disregarding
the `OEM Unlocking` checkbox, without user confirmation and without a factory reset. This allows for persistent code execution
with high privileges (kernel/root) with complete access to user data.
