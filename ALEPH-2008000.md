A heap buffer overflow exists in QuickTime's handling of panorama atoms in QTVR (QuickTime Virtual Reality) movie files. Viewing a maliciously crafted QTVR file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking of panorama atoms.
